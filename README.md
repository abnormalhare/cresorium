# Cresorium
It's a language, an element, and a *lifestyle!*

This is a project I've worked on for over a year, slowly shaping it into what it is today.

Cresorium is the government renewed version of Cogimian, the original language of Proixma Centauri b.
After It's implementation, it went through many revisions until the implosion of the planet on April 2005.
Since then a man named Jac Selgezo has tasked himself into continuing to update the language and translate
it into modern English. If you'd like to give Jac suggestions, add an issue to the github page.

If you want to suggest words or ideas, repirt it as an issue.
